  <hr>
  <article>
    <p>I've had a pretty shaky history with keyboards. I've never been able to stick
with the same board for any amount of time. They either break or I get the urge
to try out something new. Just like with distro hopping and endless vim
configuration, it's half hobby half unhealthy obsession.</p>
<p>Thankfully for my wallet I'm neither a hoarder nor collector of keyboards.
Typically owning one or two at a time before replacing them with a new purchase.</p>
<p>As an experiment I wanted to write down a complete timeline of keyboards I've
owned/used in my life up until now and reminisce of keyboards past.</p>
<h2>Unknown Cherry Keyboard</h2>
<p>I remember a few keyboards before this, but none of them are noteworthy
enough to write about. So I'm starting with this board because it was
my first mechanical keyboard.</p>
<p>I don't have any receipts to look up the model name but I believe it was
a <a href="https://www.cherry.kr/cherry-g84-4100-compact-keyboard.html">CHERRY
G84-4100</a> (or
similar). Because this was my first mechanical keyboard I didn't really have any
point of reference to compare it to. At this point in time mechanical keyboards
didn't register to me as especially popular, or even a hobby. It wasn't until later where I noticed they
became really popular, mostly amongst programmers and gaming enthusiasts.</p>
<p><img src="" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Cherry compact keyboard"></p>
<p>I remember loving this keyboard dearly right up until the moment I spilled
coffee all over it and it died. I was utterly distraught and felt so clumsy for
breaking something which (at the time) was such an expensive purchase.</p>
<h2>Noppoo Choc Mini</h2>
<p>Hooked on the clikcy sound, I think I next purchased a <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Noppoo_Choc_Mini">Noppoo Choc
Mini</a> online, which I believe it
no longer available. I distinctly remember it being a super 'pingy' keyboard
and my parents complaining about the noise, so I experimented with putting
o-rings in dampen the sound, which helped a bit.</p>
<p><img src="https://jackevansevo.github.io/images/Noppoo-Choc-Mini.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Noppoo Choc Mini"></p>
<p>Around this time I think I must have seen blank keycaps online for the first
time and thought this was the coolest thing ever 😎.</p>
<p>So like an idiot I borrowed my dads files and sanded off all the letters from
the keyboard 🤦. As you might have guessed the outcome was not great.</p>
<p>I think I sold it on eBay for a fraction of the cost to someone who probably
had the sense the swap the keycaps.</p>
<h2>Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop</h2>
<p>Perhaps jaded with mechanical keyboards at this point I decided to try
something else whacky, the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop. This was my
first foray into ergonomic style split keyboards so it took a while to get used
to, but after a while I really grew to love this keyboard. The switches in this
board were scissor switches, super quiet and an absolute joy to type on. Before
this board I'd never learnt to touch type properly so I credit the ergonomic
split with actually forcing me to learn how to touch type properly.</p>
<p><img src="https://jackevansevo.github.io/images/Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Desktop.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Microsoft Scupt Ergonomic Desktop"></p>
<p>This keyboard worked great until the 'e' key stopped working. Annoyingly this
would only start to fail when typing a specific combination of keys. The actual
error was difficult to reproduce but would intermittently cause problems when
typing, frustrating enough to stop me using this board.</p>
<h2>Das 4k Compact</h2>
<p>Dissatisfied with my earlier bodged attempt to 'improve' (and ultimately
destroy) my noppoo choc mini I fixed my eyes on the real deal: A Das 4K compact
with blank keycaps 😎.</p>
<p><img src="https://jackevansevo.github.io/images/daskeyboard-4C-ultimate.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Das 4k Compact"></p>
<p>I used this board during my final years of University, and afterwards at my
first graduate office job. I remember feeling slightly nervous to bring
it into the office because of the blank keycaps.</p>
<p>At this job I frequently had to manually type in passwords when SSH'ing onto
remote boxes (don't ask). I consider myself to be a pretty proficient touch
typist, and pretty much never have to look at the keyboard, but in high
pressure situations I'd frequently misstype passwords and be forced to ring up
tech support to unlock my account. This happened frequently enough that
I realised that blank keycaps weren't for me, at least not for the office/work
environment.</p>
<h2>Apple Magic Keyboard</h2>
<p>During the pandemic I caved a brought an M1 Mac Mini, to compliment my purchase
I also decided to buy an <a href="">apple magic keyboard</a>. The build quality was top
notch, it felt nice to type on and the compact size meant it didn't take up
much space on my desk. I can see why so many people use this kind of keyboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://jackevansevo.github.io/images/Apple-Magic-Keyboard.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Apple Magic Keyboard"></p>
<p>Running MacOS 100% of the time wasn't all that I'd hoped it to be and I found
myself swapping between my Mac Mini and other Windows or Linux machines. At
this point using the magic keyboard with it's Mac specific layout became
unpractical and confusing. To make it easier to switch between devices
I decided to look for keyboards on the market that were compatible with each
major OS and made it easy to quickly switch between layouts.</p>
<h2>My current keyboard</h2>
<p>...Which brings us to present day, currently I'm typing this article on
a Logitech MX Keys. Because it's compatible with multiple OS's I use it for
work on my company issued Macbook and personal usage on my own Linux machine.</p>
<p><img src="https://jackevansevo.github.io/images/Logitceh-MX-Keys.png" class="img-fluid rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Logitech MX Keys"></p>
<p>I really like the tying experience of this keyboard, the super low profile keys
allow me to type super fast. However I have a few personal gripes: Firstly the
board is completely wireless, which means I have to charge it via USB-C. As I'm
sat practically tethered to my desk all day a permanently wired option would
actually be more convenient as it would save me to the hassle of charging.</p>
<p>My second issue is simply the size of the board. Had I had waited a few months
I could have purchased the more compact MX Mini compact equivalent which would
have been far more convenient for me. The size is an issue for two main
reasons, predominantly because I like to travel with my keyboard, so it needs
to easily fit in a bag/suitcase. Secondly I'm not (and never have been) someone
who ever uses the numpad, so all these additional keys just sit there unused,
wasting precious real estate on my desk.</p>
<p>My final gripe is in the construction of the board itself, and how this led to
some unfortunate damage. The switch design makes it really tricky to pop off
keys in case you ever need to clean your keyboard (who amongst us hasn't at
some point eaten near their desk and got crumbs stuck under their keys). At one
point I attempted to lever/pop off a keycap and managed to break the tiny
connector the switch hooks into. So now I have a broken key on my number row
that doesn't sit fully flush and occasionally gets stuck :(</p>
<p>There appears to be no easy way to acquire replacement key caps for the MX keys
unless you're willing to pay an absolutely extortionate price from third party
vendors.</p>
<h2>My Next Board?</h2>
<p>My gripes with the Logitech MX Keys have led me once again to start evaluating
other options that are out there. I think I'm in the market for a new keyboard
before the end of 2023, but want to do plenty of research to find the best
value board. I likely write a follow up post about my criteria and research and
perhaps a follow up review if I end up pulling the trigger.</p>
